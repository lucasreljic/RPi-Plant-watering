# RPi-Plant-watering
Code for my plant watering project from grade 11. This is running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, with 4 potentiometers and a humidity/temperature sensor. The code triggers a set of relays that control a pump for each plant. The Cron version is the simplified version of the code that runs using Linux's Cron schedular.
